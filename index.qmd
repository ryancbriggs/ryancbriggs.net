I'm a social scientist and associate professor in the [Guelph Institute of Development Studies](https://www.uoguelph.ca/gids/) and [Department of Political Science](https://www.uoguelph.ca/polisci/) at the [University of Guelph](https://www.uoguelph.ca/). My research interests include [meta science](research.qmd#methodology), [foreign aid](research.qmd#foreign-aid-development-studies), [African politics](research.qmd#african-politics), and effective altruism.

Before moving to the University of Guelph, I taught at [Virginia Tech](http://www.vt.edu) and [American University](http://www.american.edu/sis).
