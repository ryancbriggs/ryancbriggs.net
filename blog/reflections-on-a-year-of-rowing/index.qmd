I did my first indoor row on February 26, 2023. I rowed 1018 metres in 4 minutes and 30 seconds. I walk a decent amount and skate in the winter, but this was the start of my first serious exercise routine in about 20 years. Since then I have rowed 273 times and covered more than 1.3 million metres.

I started rowing after noticing my physical decline. I was approaching 40 and over the last few years I began to have back pain. I have fortunate genetics and typically don't gain weight, but rather than getting chubby I was becoming weaker and slimmer. But it was the back problems---and fear of them growing worse---that finally scared me into trying to set up an exercise regime despite really hating exercise and not thinking of myself as an "exercise person."

I thought about it for a bit and came up with 4 criteria for my future exercise regime:

1. It needed to be fully body, muscle and cardio
2. I would be unlikely to injure myself
3. I could get a good workout in 20 min
4. I could do it every day or nearly every day at home

I settled on indoor rowing after a friend told me she rowed every day. I tried it once. It was awful. My initial reaction was probably the main thing going for it: I was sore and out of breath after just 4 and a half minutes. That told me that I was working a large number of muscles and getting my cardio up. Rowing was also unlikely to injure me. I later read Pete Plan which confirmed a lot of what I was already doing and taught me about mixing up the kinds of rows I was doing every day.

I could go on about the merits of rowing, but what I actually wanted to do with this post was reflect on how exercise has affected me after a year. Most of these are not directly about exercise. Some of them I've discovered myself and some I've read about.

- The most important effect of exercise has been on my mental health. I feel noticeably better after exercise. I mostly notice the improvement indirectly, in that I have become less irritable throughout the day. My wife noticed this, which validates the observation. It's really important.
- Back pain is basically gone. I sit in front of a computer or in front of my students all day, and rowing has effectively treated this.
- I think I look much better. Rowing uses lots of muscles in your legs, core, and back and over a year has led to visible improvements in my body.
- I used to think that the "calories in minus calories out" framing of exercise and body fat was sufficient. I no longer think this. For the first 5 or 6 months of rowing I made zero changes to my diet and I lost about 5 pounds, which is pretty much nothing for a year of exercise. I think the difference between exercising and not exercising is vastly more about changes to one's body that aren't reflected in body weight (including mental health) than it is about body weight and it seems unhealthy to conflate them.
- After about 6 months I did start to lose weight, but only because rowing prompted some unrelated diet changes. While exercising I drink a lot of water and after finishing my row my appetite is suppressed for a while. I noticed this and started exploiting it, changing a habit of snacking between dinner and bed by rowing after dinner and then not wanting to eat before going to bed. Since this change I've lost another 10 pounds, but I think it's important that it wasn't exercise itself that caused the weight loss---it was a behaviour change that exercise enabled.
- I'm somewhat more vain now. I used to not really think about vanity, and when it did cross my mind I appreciated how I wasn't vain at all. Now I think that's not so impressive because I didn't have anything to be vain about. I'm glad this discovery happened when I was already older.

## My rowing performance

This is the least important thing, but someone might want to know a bit about my rowing performance. My first row was a slow 1k. My next row was my first 2k, which I did in 9:08. I did my first 5k after a month of rowing and did it in 22:18. I've come pretty far, though of course many people row much faster. My 2k is the weakest entry here because I hate that distance so *so* **so** much, but overall I'm pretty proud of my progress. Aside from these times, I also managed to row over 1 million metres in 2023 despite starting in late February.

| Event | Time | Pace | Date |
|-------|------|------|------|
| 2,000m | 7:32.7 | 1:53.1 | 06/24/23 |
| 5,000m | 19:54.9 | 1:59.4 | 12/12/23 |
| 6,000m | 24:40.1 | 2:03.3 | 09/17/23 |
| 10,000m | 41:42.1 | 2:05.1 | 03/02/24 |

Rowing still hurts and is kind of terrible though. At this point I don't expect that will change.
